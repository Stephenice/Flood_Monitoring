# Project - Flood Monitoring App

The project enabling users to access flood measurement data from various monitoring stations, visualize trends through line graphs, and explore detailed readings.
The project involves leveraging the Real-Time flood-monitoring API provided by the Environmental Agency to create a functional web application capable of displaying flood measurement data that:

- Provides some control to select an individual measurement station.

- Once a singular station is selected, shows a line graph (with associated table) of that stationâ€™s readings over the last 24 hours.

## Features

- Station Selection: Users can easily select individual measurement stations from the Environmental Agency's network.

- 24-Hour Data Visualization: The tool displays a line graph illustrating flood readings over the last 24 hours for the chosen station.

- Detailed Data Table: Alongside the line graph, a corresponding table exhibits detailed flood measurement data for the selected station within the specified timeframe.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5

- CSS3

- JavaScript
