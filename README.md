# Task - Flood Monitoring App

The task involves leveraging the Real-Time flood-monitoring API provided by the Environmental Agency to create a functional web application capable of displaying flood measurement data that:

- Provides some control to select an individual measurement station.

- Once a singular station is selected, shows a line graph (with associated table) of that station’s readings over the last 24 hours.

## Features

- Station Selection: Users can easily select individual measurement stations from the Environmental Agency's network.

- 24-Hour Data Visualization: The tool displays a line graph illustrating flood readings over the last 24 hours for the chosen station.

- Detailed Data Table: Alongside the line graph, a corresponding table exhibits detailed flood measurement data for the selected station within the specified timeframe.
